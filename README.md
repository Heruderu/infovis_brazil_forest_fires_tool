This project is meant to show the students skills on developing an Information Visualization Tool. More specifically, a tool to analyse the occurrences of Forest Fires in Brazil, by state, by year and month, with a single view of a Choropleth Map on the Left Panel, and Bar Charts with more in-depth information on the Right Panel.



**This project was made with d3.js for manipulating the content, and SVGs to display information.**

* You can check the project in the github repository: https://github.com/Heruderu/infovis_brazil_forest_fires_tool

* You can also read more in the report included in this repository.

* You need Python to run this application. It will be available on localhost (for example, port 8000). For Python 2 and Python 3, you can use:

        python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
        
        python3 -m http.server 8000
