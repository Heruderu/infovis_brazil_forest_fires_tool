This project is meant to show the students skills on developing an Information Visualization Tool. More specifically, a tool to analyse the occurrences of Forest Fires in Brazil, by state, by year and month, with a single view of a Choropleth Map on the Left Panel, and Bar Charts with more in-depth information on the Right Panel.



This project was made with d3.js for manipulating the content, and SVGs to display information.
